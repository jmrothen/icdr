# icd_scrape

started off as a webscrape project to consolidate the icd10 codes into a nice hierarchical categorization table

idk i'll probably add some more functionality to it at this point, seems fun

## future additions

-   CPT Codes

-   ICD-10-CM

-   ~~US Billtype Codes~~

-   ~~US Revenue Codes~~

-   Place of service code

-   maybe integrate nyu non-emergent algorithm

-   might integrate the functionality of the comorbidity packaged

-   CCS?

-   Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC)?

-   DRG Codes?

Not sure how much I'll add, but the more the merrier

Feel free to reach out with ideas/request if you stumble across this project
